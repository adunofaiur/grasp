	Before the page loads, we create a bsService object. Do not change the name - that will break stuff :(
		The arguments passed in are a list of strings. Each string is an extensionID. these particular ID's are
		for the released version of the IdeaMACHE plugin and for a secret, special version of the extension 
		that I have
	bsService will see if any of the extenions are availabe. If so it will use them. Otherwise, it will rely on the
		web-hosted version of bigsemantics
